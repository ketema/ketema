# Hi, I'm Ketema Harris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lifelong programmer and software creator with over 20 years of professional experience.  I serve as Director of Development at Blue Shield of California.

My passion lies in Test Driven functional programming.  Haskell is my favorite language followed by Python, PERL, Rust, and shell scripting.

Recently I have reignited my passion for architecting robust software through AI assistance.  As a father and husband time is a luxury and I am enjoying new found productivity gains.

Beyond tech, I believe in maintaining both body and mind: I stay physically fit, love exploring and traveling, and enjoy glamping in my truck and riding my dirt bike.
